# Overview

Obie is a simple iOS chatroom application that provides Facebook authentication and allows users to send broadcast messages in four different chatrooms: Sports, Politics, Fashion, and Technology. It was built using NodeJS and ReactNative, and it relies primarily on TCP segments for network communication, although HTTP requests are used in several cases. The application is currently hosted locally.
